# ItemDisplayInfo
http://www.ac-web.org/forums/showthread.php?226167-How-to-easily-find-icon-name-(not-displayID)-of-a-WOTLK-item

I made this application to ease the search of item displayid and icon name
by combining the two tables into a single app + some minor features.
Thanks to totolencule for giving me the idea.

Programming language used: C# (Visual Studio 2015)

Instructions:

Before starting up you must have XAMPP (MariaDB 10) installed in order to get this application working.

Download XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

1. Execute itemdisplayinfo.sql into your database

2. Download and extract Wotlk-Interface-(6304)ICONS.rar
    All icons that I could find in wotlk data folder.

3. Start the app.

4. Have fun!

Known bugs:

'Search by Name' doesn't change icons.
